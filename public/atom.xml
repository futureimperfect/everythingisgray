    <id>http://everythingisgray.herokuapp.com/2010/08/18/how-i-use-automator-to-post-images-to-tumblr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I have been drawing everyday on 2.5 x 3.5 inch pieces of Bristol board as part of my most recent &lsquo;<a href="http://koobtra.com/">kooBtrA</a>&rsquo; project. kooBtrA = ArtBook in reverse, as I plan to self publish a full-color book containing all the images sometime after one year passes.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, finding the time to draw every day can be challenging. Not to mention the fact that I&rsquo;ve also been posting these images to my Tumbleog; which includes scanning, resizing, and logging into Tumblr to post the image along with a description and tag. This became mundane after the first few days of posting, so I decided to set time aside to automate this process, as doing so would surely save me time in the long run.</p>

<p>I did a bit of research and discovered that Tumblr offers the ability to send posts via email. This immediately gave me the idea of using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_(software">Automator</a>) to streamline this process, as Automator offers a very straightforward &lsquo;New Mail Message&rsquo; Action. This would allow me to create an Image Capture Plugin that grabs the image that was scanned and include it in the email message, right? Well, yes, but with one caveat. With Snow Leopard&rsquo;s introduction came a few changes, one of which removes the ability to scan to a specified folder while using an Image Capture Plugin, (the image is saved to the ~/Pictures folder, then the Workflow runs). The workaround in my case was to use a Folder Action, which would result in the Workflow running any time a new file is added to the specified folder.</p>

<p>What I had been doing until this point was scanning the image to a subfolder of my ~/Documents folder; scaling the image to 300px max on either side depending on orientation; then uploading the image to Tumblr.com along with a description and tag. The Folder Action Workflow I ended up producing cuts the time this took in half.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was create two variables. One for the name of the post and one for the number of the post. You can achieve this by right or control clicking in the variables window at the bottom of the application window and choosing &lsquo;New variable.&rsquo; I left the value blank, as this will vary with each post. The next step was to start dragging actions over to the right of the application window. The first is an &lsquo;Ask for Text&rsquo; Action, which asks for the name of the post, then sets the value of the variable. The same goes for the number of post. The Workflow then asks for the Finder items to act on, then copies them to a new location and scales them to 300px. Finally, the &lsquo;New Mail Message&rsquo; Action is added, which utilizes the name and number variables that were set previously, as well as receives the resized image from the previous Action. The last Action that was added was &lsquo;Send Outgoing Messages,&rsquo; which is fairly self explanatory.</p>

<p>Below is the printed Workflow for your reference should you wish to accomplish something similar. If you have any suggestions as to improving this Automator Workflow please leave a comment. For more information regarding Tumblr&rsquo;s post via email option please visit <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/email_publishing">http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/email_publishing</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://everythingisgray.herokuapp.com/2010/07/20/restore-mysql-database-from-ibdata-and-frm-files/"/>
    <updated>2010-07-20T18:48:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://everythingisgray.herokuapp.com/2010/07/20/restore-mysql-database-from-ibdata-and-frm-files</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I was presented with a problem that involved restoring a MySQL database for a client using only the <code>/data</code> folder from an original MySQL installation. The solution turned out to be rather simple, but that didn&rsquo;t stop me from racking my brain for a few hours. Thus, I thought I&rsquo;d share my experience in hopes of helping others that may run into this.</p>

<p><em>NOTE</em> The MySQL database I was tasked with restoring was associated with a WordPress installation. My guess is that this is irrelevant, though.</p>

<p><em>ALSO NOTE</em> This article assumes you are comfortable with software solutions such as <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a> and/or <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php">phpMyAdmin</a>.</p>

<p>I made the decision early on to solve this problem locally, (I find that working directly from a web server usually just gets me into trouble).  I use MAMP on a regular basis and as such have quite a few MySQL databases associated with that installation. Rather than fooling with this at all I opted to use XAMPP on a Windows XP SP2 machine. Either one of these solutions will work, as they essentially provide the same services. I chose to avoid using MAMP on my machine because of everything I have invested into that application, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to.</p>

<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do is install a fresh copy of either MAMP, (Mac only), or XAMPP. Then create an empty database using phpMyAdmin with the same name as your original database, (the one you&rsquo;re trying to restore). For example, if your previous database was called &lsquo;wordpress,&rsquo; in phpMyAdmin, (under the &lsquo;Create new database&rsquo; text field), you would enter &lsquo;wordpress.&rsquo; This will create a folder named <code>wordpress</code> in <code>/Applications/MAMP/db/mysql</code> if you&rsquo;re using MAMP, or <code>C:\xampp\mysql</code> if you&rsquo;re using XAMPP. At this point you&rsquo;ll want to turn off the MySQL service. Now, copy the contents of, (not the entire folder), your mysql database folder that contains the .frm files to the new location. The next step is to copy the <code>ibdata1</code> file to the MySQL folder in either XAMPP or MAMP, then start the MySQL service again. Now you should be able to locate your database tables in phpMyAdmin.</p>

<p>At this point, (assuming you don&rsquo;t want to keep the data locally on your machine), you&rsquo;ll want to export the database using phpMyAdmin. Be sure to check Add DROP TABLE, choose SQL as the export type, and check the &lsquo;Save as file&rsquo; checkbox. The .sql file that will be generated can easily be imported into another instance of phpMyAdmin. The new database doesn&rsquo;t need to have the same name as the previous database, either. I was unable to use my previous database name because the site I was working on had been moved to a shared hosting server, (where someone had already chosen the name of my previous database), and everything worked fine.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that this can be accomplished whether or not your server is running phpMyAdmin. There are plenty of alternatives available that will allow you to accomplish the same tasks, and there&rsquo;s always the command line. The most important step is to simply copy the contents of the <code>/data</code> folder and the <code>ibdata1</code> file. Hope this helps!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having recently purchased a new MacBook Pro and electing to skip the option of running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Assistant_(Apple">Migration Assistant</a>) to transfer my data and settings, I noticed that a few applications were behaving differently. Over the years I&rsquo;ve configured quite a few things on my Mac, and eventually I became accustomed to said customizations. One of the first things I noticed was that when I would unarchive a zip file, the compressed file would stay put. I remembered that a few years ago I learned of a cool way to configure Mac OS X&rsquo;s built-in Archive Utility, (using a System Preference pane), so I immediately went digging. To do this, simply navigate to <code>therootofyourharddrive/System/Library/CoreServices</code>. From there right or control click on Archive Utility.app, and select &ldquo;Show Package Contents.&rdquo; A new window will open containing a folder named <code>Contents</code>, within which you&rsquo;ll find <code>Resources</code>, and finally <code>Archives.prefPane</code>. Opening this preference pane will result in System Preferences.app asking if you&rsquo;d like to install for all users or for this user only. Voila! Now you can tell Archive Utility to delete the archive after expanding it.</p>

    <updated>2009-07-20T19:31:43-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://everythingisgray.herokuapp.com/2009/07/20/cappuccino-web-framework</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So lately I&rsquo;ve been playing around with the <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino web framework</a> and a nifty little programming language called Objective-J. The Cappuccino framework allows you to create desktop class applications for the browser, and gives you the ability to run these applications on the desktop, (similar to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe AIR</a>). One of the many benefits of being able to create applications that run on the desktop is having the ability to run the application while offline.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about Objective-J is that it is based on Objective-C, but any valid JavaScript code is accepted as valid Objective-J code. A fun way to look at it is that Objective-J is to JavaScript as Objective-C is to C.</p>

<p>Cappuccino is frequently compared to another JavaScript framework called <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/">SproutCore</a>, which also allows you to build rich Mac-like applications for the browser, (just look at <a href="http://me.com/">MobileMe</a>). Both Cappuccino and SproutCore utilize the same icon set and window chrome as desktop Mac applications, which can look incredible.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see Cappuccino and Objective-J in action, take a look at <a href="http://280slides.com/">280 Slides</a>, and if you&rsquo;d like to learn more, read the <a href="http://cappuccino.org/learn/tutorials/">tutorials</a> on Cappuccino.org and <a href="http://cappuccino.org/starter">download the sample application</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strike>Today</strike> On July 2, 2009, the W3C announced that the XHTML 2 working group will cease development by the end of 2009. Of course all this means is that more time, effort, and man power will be focused on the HTML 5 specification, which is going to drastically change the web, (just take a look at <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a>). This also means that we won&rsquo;t have any spec wars to deal with, which are almost as bad as format wars, (HD DVD vs. Blu-Ray anyone?)</p>

<p>From the W3C:</p>

<p><strong>XHTML 2 Working Group Expected to Stop Work End of 2009, W3C to Increase Resources on HTML 5</strong></p>

<p>2009-07-02: Today the Director announces that when the XHTML 2 Working Group charter expires as scheduled at the end of 2009, the charter will not be renewed. By doing so, and by increasing resources in the Working Group, W3C hopes to accelerate the progress of HTML 5 and clarify W3C&rsquo;s position regarding the future of HTML. A FAQ answers questions about the future of deliverables of the XHTML 2 Working Group, and the status of various discussions related to HTML.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How quickly can you recognize a corporate identity? I recently found <a href="http://www.graphicdesignblog.org/famous-logo-game/">an article on GraphicDesignBlog.org</a> that makes an interesting game out of it. They display a small fraction of the logo and you are to guess the corporation associated with that identity. I knew all but three right off the bat. Can you guess which one&rsquo;s I missed?</p>

<p>I find that the best and most memorable logos almost always pass this test. Number six is a great example, (only a miniscule portion of the logo is displayed, yet I was able to determine the identity almost immediately).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I heard about a week ago that someone had done a mockup of a possible redesign for the <strong>American Airlines</strong> website, and the first thing I did was take a look at <a href="http://www.aa.com/aa/homePage.do">their existing site</a>. It&rsquo;s unbelievable to me that such a huge corporation with so many resources could produce such a terrible, unusable site. I for one haven&rsquo;t ever needed to use the site, but a user interface designer named Dustin Curtis has, (which inspired him to create the mockup.) The redesign is visually interesting as well as functional. You should read more about it/take a look at it <a href="http://dustincurtis.com/dear_american_airlines.html">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After about a month of searching for a WordPress image gallery plugin that is both powerful and easy to use, I came acrossÂ <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/">NextGEN Gallery</a>. This plugin is extremely easy to implement, and once activated is easy to maintain/update. I like the fact that you can create multiple galleries and group them together in albums, too. It&rsquo;s also a breeze to update a gallery or album once it&rsquo;s been posted. I&rsquo;m currently using this plugin for my portfolio, (which should include more than a few images soon), and overall I&rsquo;m very pleased.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I submitted an update to my WordPress theme Simplixity, which improves how images are handled in posts and fixes an issue that existed while no widgets were activated in the admin panel. You can view and download it <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplixity">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already begun working on the next update, which should include an easily customizable client.css file, for making quick changes to the theme.</p>
