Today I released the first episode of [FlintCast](http://flintcast.com/), a podcast that covers events happening in Flint, MI. I am co-hosting this podcast with [Vanna Ward](http://gallery.me.com/afterbirth). I apologize for how rough the first episode is, just keep in mind that the entire podcast was created in less than one week, (from conception to execution). You can check it out [here](http://flintcast.com/).

P.S. We'll have the feed up on iTunes soon, (it's already been submitted).
