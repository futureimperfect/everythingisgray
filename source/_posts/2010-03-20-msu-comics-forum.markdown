Thanks to my mentor and friend [Ryan Claytor](http://www.elephanteater.com/) I'll be tabling at the MSU Comics Forum on March 27, 2010. The event is held annually at, you guessed it, Michigan State University. There I'll be showcasing my latest comic, "Here For Now," (which I'll soon have examples of in the portfolio section of this site), as well as my first comic, "Stars Beneath Stars."
