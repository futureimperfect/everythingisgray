Have you ever needed to run a quick download speed test, but were too lazy to open up a new browser window and use one of the Web-based tools? Or perhaps you just prefer to use the command-line like me. Never fear, because appending this line to your ~/.bash_profile will allow you test your download speed from within your login shell by simply typing `speedtest`.
