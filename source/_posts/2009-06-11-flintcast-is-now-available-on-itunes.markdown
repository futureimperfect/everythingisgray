The folks at iTunes recently accepted my new podcast, which is called [FlintCast](http://flintcast.com/). It is hosted by myself and Vanna Ward.

FlintCast aims to cover fun and interesting events happening in Flint, MI. The podcast is currently audio only but we'll be including video in the feed in the near future. If you'd like to download individual episodes or subscribe you can do so now [on iTunes](http://bit.ly/oxFPy).
