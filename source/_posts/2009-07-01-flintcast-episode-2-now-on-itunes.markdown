So I've managed to get the latest episode of my podcast, [FlintCast](http://flintcast.com/), on iTunes.

I spent a few hours trying to figure out just why it wasn't showing up, turns out I was just impatient, (pinging the servers didn't seem to help, either). Troubleshooting feeds surely can be a headache.

If you'd like to download individual episodes or subscribe you can do so [here](http://bit.ly/oxFPy).
