Hello, I'm a 24 year old designer and technology enthusiast from Flint, MI USA. I am interested in web design/development, art, and photography. I am currently a visual communications major at a university in Flint, MI, and occasionally do freelance design work. You can contact me via email at james [at] everythingisgray [dot] com.
