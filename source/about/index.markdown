Hi there! My name is James Barclay. I'm an [IT consultant][1], designer, developer, and father. I live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm interested in art, open-source, OS X, software development, and security. I work behind the scenes at a lot of awesome companies, and I frequently get to solve interesting problems for them.

From April 2010 - April 2011 I drew something every day and posted the drawings on my [Tumbleog][2]. I've also made [a][3] [few][4] [comics][5], designed a [few][6] [Websites][7], and started and co-hosted a podcast about my former hometown of Flint, MI.

You can contact me via email at james [at] thisdomain. I can also be found as "futureimperfect" on [Twitter][8], [GitHub][9], and many other places on the Web.
