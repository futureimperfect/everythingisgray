![Me][me]

Hi there! My name is James Barclay. I'm a Tools Engineer at [Pinterest][1], a designer and developer, and a father. I live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm interested in art, open-source, OS X, software development, and security. I was one of the original developers of [AutoPkgr][2], and I still occasionally contribute to the project. I also work on a commercial Mac app called [TMNotifier][3].

I once drew a trading card every day for a year and posted the images to my [Tumbleog][4]. I've also made [a][5] [few][6] [comics][7], designed a [few][8] [Websites][9], spoken [at][10] [a][11] [few][12] [conferences][13], built a moderately popular [WordPress theme][14], and started and co-hosted a podcast about my former hometown of Flint, MI.

You can contact me via email at james [at] thisdomain. I can also be found as "futureimperfect" on [Twitter][15], [GitHub][16], and many other places around the Web.

You can also download my résumé, if you really want to. ([**PDF**](/downloads/resume.pdf))
